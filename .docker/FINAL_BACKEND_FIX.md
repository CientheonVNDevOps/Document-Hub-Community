# üîß Complete Backend Health Check Fix

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Port Mismatch ‚ùå
```javascript
const port = process.env.PORT || 3002;  // Wrong default!
```
Backend was listening on port 3002 instead of 3000

**Fixed**: Changed to `process.env.PORT || 3000`

### Issue 2: Missing Health Endpoint ‚ùå
No `/health` endpoint existed in the NestJS app

**Fixed**: Created health module with `/health` endpoint

### Issue 3: Start Period Override ‚ö†Ô∏è
Coolify config has `start_period: 120s` but logs show "5 seconds"
This means Coolify UI overrides it to 5 seconds

**Solution**: Increase start period in Coolify UI settings

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Port Default ‚úÖ
**File**: `apps/backend/src/main.ts`
```javascript
// Before
const port = process.env.PORT || 3002;

// After  
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

### 2. Added Health Endpoint ‚úÖ
Created:
- `apps/backend/src/health/health.controller.ts`
- `apps/backend/src/health/health.module.ts`

### 3. Excluded Health from API Prefix ‚úÖ
**File**: `apps/backend/src/main.ts`
```javascript
app.setGlobalPrefix('api', {
  exclude: ['health'],
});
```

### 4. Updated Coolify Config ‚úÖ
**File**: `coolify-backend.yml`
```yaml
healthcheck:
  start_period: 120s  # Increased from 40s
  retries: 5  # Increased from 3
```

## Deploy Steps

### Step 1: Rebuild Backend
```bash
cd apps/backend

# Build with health endpoint fix
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 \
  --tag lykny97/takingnote-backend:latest .
```

### Step 2: Push to Docker Hub
```bash
docker push lykny97/takingnote-backend:latest
```

### Step 3: Update Coolify Settings
In Coolify UI for your backend app:
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Health Check**
2. Set **Start Period**: `120` seconds (not 5!)
3. Set **Retries**: `5`
4. Verify port mapping: `3000:3000`

### Step 4: Redeploy
Click **"Redeploy"** in Coolify UI

## Verification

After deployment, test:
```bash
# Health endpoint
curl http://your-backend:3000/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","service":"takingnote-backend"}
```

## Expected Results

‚úÖ Backend listens on port 3000  
‚úÖ `/health` endpoint returns JSON  
‚úÖ Health checks pass after 120s  
‚úÖ Container shows as healthy  

## Important Note

The Coolify logs showed "start period (5 seconds)" even though config says 120s. This means **Coolify UI is overriding** your config file. You must manually set it to 120 seconds in the Coolify UI!

**Status**: Ready to rebuild, push, and redeploy! üöÄ
